## Mode dispatch

0. **Progressive disclosure check:** Before dispatching to a mode, apply the portable skill contract. If a current calibration interface is available in this checkout, use it; otherwise rely on the mode table below. If a mode is locked, show the unlock message and stop.

1. Parse the mode from the argument (first word).
2. If no mode given, infer from the user's message using the keyword table below.
3. If still ambiguous, list available modes and ask.
4. Read `modes/<mode>/SKILL.md` completely.
5. If `modes/<mode>/gotchas.yml` exists, read it before executing.
6. Follow the mode's instructions exactly as written.

| Mode | File | Keywords |
|---|---|---|
| harden | modes/harden/SKILL.md | /harden, harden audit, harden fix |
| secure | the ds-fullstack pack's secure mode | secure:, security review:, audit code: |

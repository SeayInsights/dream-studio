## What it does

dream-studio wraps Claude Code with a structured developer workflow:

- **Think → Plan → Build → Review → Verify → Ship** — a gated pipeline that prevents skipping steps
- **Context budget management** — warns at 65%, hands off at 75%, blocks at 82% with progressive messaging and auto-handoff notes
- **Session memory** — structured handoff notes and recaps written automatically to `.sessions/<date>/`
- **Project health** — pulse checks, CI status, stale branch detection, and a draft lesson queue
- **Domain skills** — Godot 4, SaaS (React 19 + Cloudflare Workers), Power Platform, MCP servers, career ops

---

## Requirements

| Requirement | Version |
|---|---|
| Claude Code | latest |
| Python | 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12 |
| OS | Windows, macOS, Linux |

> Python 3.14+ is not recommended — use 3.12 for full compatibility.

---

## Installation

**From the registry:**

```bash
claude plugins install dream-studio
```

**From source:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SeayInsights/dream-studio.git
claude plugins install file://path/to/dream-studio
```

**Install dev dependencies (for contributing):**

```bash
make install-dev
# or: pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

---

## Quick Start

Once installed, dream-studio activates automatically in every Claude Code session.

```
/think   Shape a feature idea into a spec
/plan    Break the approved spec into ordered tasks
/build   Execute the plan with subagent-per-task
/review  Two-stage quality check
/verify  Evidence-based proof it works
/ship    Pre-deploy gate — blocks on any FAIL
```

**Harden a project** (run once to scaffold missing standards files):

```
/harden
```

**Run the test suite:**

```bash
make test
```

| `on-workflow-progress` | PostToolUse | Advances workflow DAG state |

---

## Status Bar

dream-studio installs a status bar (configured in `~/.claude/settings.json`) that renders on every prompt:

```
Claude Sonnet 4.6  ⬢ dream-studio:main●  ████████░░ 78%  Effort ◉
```

| Segment | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Model name | Active Claude model |
| `⬢ repo:branch` | Git branch; color = pulse health (green/yellow/red) |
| `●` | Uncommitted changes present |
| Context bar `%` | Normalized against Claude's ~83% auto-compact trigger — so 100% = compact point, not full window. Displayed value is ~20% higher than raw token fill. Green < 65%, yellow 65–80%, red > 80% |
| `Effort ◉/◐/○` | Current thinking effort (high/medium/low) |

After `/compact`, the bar resets to `0%` on the next prompt.

---

## Workflows

Pre-built YAML DAG workflows in `workflows/`:

<!-- workflows-table-start -->
| Workflow | Nodes | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `comprehensive-review` | review-code → review-security → review-tests → review-perf → review-docs → synthesize → … | Five-way parallel review with synthesis report |
| `feature-research` | intake → research-repos → research-issues → research-prs → research-code → research-synthesis → … | GitHub research pipeline — researches any Claude feature, integration, MCP server, hook, or skill, then recommends a native integration strategy (make it your own) with a drop-in alternative. |
| `fix-issue` | diagnose → plan-fix → implement-fix → review → verify → report | Diagnose a bug, plan a fix, implement, review, and verify |
| `game-feature` | think → plan → build → review-gameplay → review-data → validate-engine → … | Game feature from design through implementation with Godot-specific QA |
| `hotfix` | debug → build → verify → ship | Fast debug-fix-verify cycle for production issues |
| `idea-to-pr` | think → plan → build → review-code → review-security → review-tests → … | Feature concept through implementation to merged PR |
| `project-audit` | harden → secure → review → report | Full project audit — harden (structure + best practices), secure (OWASP + STRIDE), then re… |
| `prototype` | think → build → verify | Fast prototype — think then build, skip formal review. |
| `safe-refactor` | plan-refactor → implement → type-check → test → review → verify → … | Plan a refactor, implement, validate with type checks and tests, review, and verify |
| `studio-onboard` | discovery → baseline-fetch → breakpoint-analysis → gap-analysis → improvement-scan → synthesis → … | Dream-studio onboarding audit for an end user's existing environment. |
<!-- workflows-table-end -->

**Usage:**

```
workflow: run hotfix
workflow status
workflow resume
workflow abort
```

## Configuration

### Context Thresholds

Defined in `hooks/lib/context_handoff.py`.

**How the numbers work:** Claude Code's auto-compact fires at roughly 83% of the raw context window. dream-studio normalizes all context usage against that 83% trigger point — so `100%` on this scale = the moment Claude would auto-compact. This is the **same scale the status bar displays**, which means the percentage shown in the bar is approximately 20% higher than the raw token fill level (e.g., status bar shows 70% when the window is ~58% full). The threshold constants below are in this normalized scale and match exactly what you see on screen.

| Constant | Status bar value | ≈ Raw fill | Behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| `WARN_PCT` | 55% | ~46% | "Growing" — fires once per 5% increment as context climbs |
| `COMPACT_PCT` | 70% | ~58% | "Run /compact soon" — once per session |
| `HANDOFF_PCT` | 75% | ~62% | Auto-writes handoff + recap to `.sessions/<date>/` |
| `URGENT_PCT` | 82% | ~68% | Blocks prompt; requires `/compact` to continue |
| Auto-compact | 100% | ~83% | Claude Code compacts automatically (not configurable here) |

Active milestones add a **+10 pp boost**: effective trigger points shift to 65 / 80 / 85 / 92% on the status bar, so milestone work is not interrupted.  
Post-`/compact`, warnings are suppressed for 2 turns and the WARN increment counter resets.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `SENTRY_DSN` | Enable Sentry error tracking in hooks |
| `CLAUDE_PROJECTS_DIR` | Override default `~/.claude/projects/` path (useful for tests) |

### Runtime Data (`~/.dream-studio/`)

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `audit.jsonl` | Append-only hook event log |
| `token-log.jsonl` | Per-session token usage |
| `corrections.jsonl` | Agent correction history |
| `meta/pulse-<date>.md` | Daily health report |
| `meta/draft-lessons/` | Unreviewed lesson drafts pending Director review |
| `career-ops/` | Career pipeline state |
| `state/` | Sentinel files (milestone-active, harden-nudge, compact-cooldown, etc.) |

Session notes are written to `.sessions/<YYYY-MM-DD>/` inside each project.

## Enforcement Status

What fires automatically vs what requires a manual command:

| Standard | Enforced | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| Context budget + handoff | **Auto** | `on-context-threshold` — blocks at 82%, writes handoff at 75% |
| Project health check | **Auto** | `on-pulse` — every prompt |
| Session token logging | **Auto** | `on-token-log` — every Stop |
| Security pattern scan | **Auto** | `on-security-scan` — every Edit/Write |
| CHANGELOG reminder | **Auto** | `on-changelog-nudge` — every Stop when source changed |
| Hardening nudge | **Auto** | `on-tool-activity` — once per project on first Edit/Write |
| Code format | **Auto** | Pre-commit black hook |
| Code lint | **Auto** | Pre-commit flake8 hook |
| Test coverage ≥ 70% | **Auto** | CI on every push/PR |
| Full security review | **Manual** | `/secure` — OWASP + STRIDE |
| Folder structure audit | **Manual** | `/structure-audit` |
| Documentation quality | **Manual** | `/harden` item 19 + template scaffold |
| Workflow gating | **Manual** | `/workflow run <name>` |

> Run `/harden audit` to get a scored gap report for any project. Items marked Manual require intentional invocation — they are not wired to hooks to avoid excessive interruption during development.
